# FiveM-names.lua-Maker

This program is designed to take a gxt2 file saved as a txt and then convert it into a names.lua file ready for use in a FiveM server.

## How to user
Place the EXE in a folder along with your gxt2.txt file (should be a direct copy of your global.gxt2 file from your addon's RPF)
MAKE SURE you name the txt file as gxt2.txt!

once done start the program, check it looks right in the console, then close or press enter when it says so.

Done!

## WARNING
This program will overwrite any names.lua file present in the same directory as the exe.
